# Phase 2: Systematic Rule Testing Results

**Testing Date**: 2025-11-13 (Initial), Updated 2025-11-13 (Enhancement Audit)
**Framework Version**: v4.5.0 (updated from v4.1.1)
**Hooks Version**: v4.5.0 with 26 hooks (updated from v3.3.0)
**Tester**: Claude (Session 004, Enhancement Audit)

**Test Status Summary**:
- ✅ Tier 1 Rules (Critical): 5/7 tested and passing (71%)
- ⚠️ Tier 2 Rules (Important): 8/13 tested, 5 pending (62%)
- 📋 **Action Required**: Defer remaining tests to dedicated testing session (v4.5.1 or v4.6.0)
- 🎯 **Priority**: Focus on enforcement validation (100% complete via validate_all_rules.sh)

**Note**: During 2025-11-13 Enhancement Audit, framework integrity validation confirmed 100% enforcement coverage for all 20 rules via automated testing (scripts/validate_all_rules.sh). Individual behavioral tests documented below remain partially complete and should be finished in a dedicated testing session.

---

## Testing Methodology

For each rule:
1. Read rule documentation from rules/CLAUDE.md
2. Design test scenario to verify compliance
3. Execute test
4. Verify behavior matches documentation
5. Document result (PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL) with evidence
